This packages provides estimators for multinomial logit models in their
conditional logit (for discrete choices) and baseline logit variants (for
categorical responses), optionally with overdispersion or random effects. .
Random effects models are estimated using the PQL technique (based on a Laplace
approximation) or the MQL technique (based on a Solomon-Cox approximation).
Estimates should be treated with caution if the group sizes are small.
