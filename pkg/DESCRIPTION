Title: Mixed Conditional Logit Models
Version: 0.3-2
Date: 2015-01-18
Author: Martin Elff
Maintainer: Martin Elff <elff@gmx.com>
Description: This packages provides allows to estimate conditional logit models of binary responses and multinomial counts,
  with or without alternative-specific random effects (random intercepts only, no random slopes yet).
  The current implementation of the estimator for random effects variants of the model uses a Laplace approximation (or PQL) 
  approach and thus should be used only if groups sizes are large.
