Description: Provides estimators for multinomial logit models in their
    conditional logit (for discrete choices) and baseline logit variants
    (for categorical responses), optionally with overdispersion or random
    effects. Random effects models are estimated using the PQL technique
    (based on a Laplace approximation) or the MQL technique (based on a
    Solomon-Cox approximation). Estimates should be treated
    with caution if the group sizes are small.
