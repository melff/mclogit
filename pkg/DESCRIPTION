Title: Multinomial Logit Models, with or without Random Effects or Overdispersion
Version: 0.8.4
Date: 2020-06-12
Author: Martin Elff
Maintainer: Martin Elff <mclogit@elff.eu>
Description: Provides estimators for multinomial logit models in their
    conditional logit and baseline logit variants, with or without random effects,
    with or without overdispersion. 
    Random effects models are estimated using the PQL technique (based on a Laplace approximation)
    or the MQL technique (based on a Solomon-Cox approximation). Estimates should be treated
    with caution if the group sizes are small.
