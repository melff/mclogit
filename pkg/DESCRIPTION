Title: Mixed Conditional Logit Models
Version: 0.4.4
Date: 2016-12-25
Author: Martin Elff
Maintainer: Martin Elff <mclogit@elff.eu>
Description: Specification and estimation of conditional logit models of binary responses and multinomial counts is provided,
  with or without alternative-specific random effects (random intercepts only, no random slopes yet).
  The current implementation of the estimator for random effects variants of the model uses a Laplace approximation (or PQL) 
  approach and thus should be used only if groups sizes are large.
