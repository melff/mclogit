Title: Mixed Conditional Logit Models
Version: 0.7
Date: 2020-05-11
Author: Martin Elff
Maintainer: Martin Elff <mclogit@elff.eu>
Description: Specification and estimation of conditional logit models of binary
    responses and multinomial counts is provided, with or without
    random effects. The current implementation of the estimator for random
    effects variances uses a Laplace approximation (or PQL) approach and thus should
    be used only if groups sizes are large.
