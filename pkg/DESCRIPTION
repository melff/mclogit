Description: This packages provides a function to estimate parameters for 
  the conditional logit model (also with multinomial counts), and for the
  mixed conditional logit model, or conditional logit with random effects
  (random intercepts only, no random slopes yet).
  The current implementation of random effects is limited to 
  the PQL technique, which requires large cluster sizes.
