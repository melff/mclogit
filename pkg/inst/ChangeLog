2016-09-01:
  - Fixed `mclogit.fit()` and `predict.mclogit()` to work better without covariates.

2016-02-07:
  - Explicitely import package "methods"

2016-01-17:
  - Import `as` from package "methods".
  - Make sure `nobs` is defined in `mclogit.fit.rePQL`.

2016-01-16: 
  - Updated `DESCRIPTION` file: Maintainer email address changed and no "This package" 
    at start of package discriptions.

2015-10-08:
  - Fix display of number of observations
  - Drop redundant coefficients

2015-08-01:
  - Added row and column names to estimator result of `vcov()`
  - Make sure that scripts run with "mclogit" loaded by `devtools::load_all()`

2015-07-15:
  - mclogit, mclogit.fit: Added support for starting values.

2015-07-03:
  - predict.mblogit: 'contrasts.arg' not 'contast.arg' ...
  - predict-methods now should handle NAs in newdata arguments better.

2015-06-17: 
  - Corrected handling of weights and standard errors of prediction.

2015-06-15:
  - 'getSummary' methods now return "contrasts" and "xlevels" components.
  - Fixed prediction method for 'mclogit' results.
  - Added 'fitted' and 'predict' methods for 'mblogit' results.

2015-01-25: 
  - Added support for multinomial baseline logit models in form of 'mblogit' as a frontend to 'mclogit.fit'

2015-01-23:
  - Added URLs to DESCRIPTION file

2015-01-21:
  - Added `nobs` and `extractAIC` methods for `mclogit` objects, so that `drop1.default` should work with these.

2015-01-19:
  - Added call to result of `getSummary.mclogit`. 

2015-01-18: 
  - Cleanup of NAMESPACE file; added aliases to methods for `mclogit` objects so that users can see that they are present.
  - Export `mclogit.fit`, and `mclogit.fit.rePQL` to enable use by other packages.

2014-10-13: 
  Simplified some namespace dependencies. Eliminated useless pseudo-R-squared statistics 
  from getSummary.mclogit

2014-08-23:
  Added 'anova' methods

2014-03-10:
  Refactored code -- algorithms should be more transparent and robust now (hopefully!).
  mclogit without and with random effects can handle missing values now.
  Fixed predict method -- use of napredict; handles single indep-variable situation now.
  Fixed embarassing typo -- prior weights do work now (again?). 
  Included AIC and BIC methods contributed by Nic Elliot <nic_elliot@yahoo.co.uk>
