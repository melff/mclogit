2015-01-21:
  Added `nobs` and `extractAIC` methods for `mclogit` objects, so that `drop1.default` should work with these.

2015-01-19:
  Added call to result of `getSummary.mclogit`. 

2015-01-18: 
  - Cleanup of NAMESPACE file; added aliases to methods for `mclogit` objects so that users can see that they are present.
  - Export `mclogit.fit`, and `mclogit.fit.rePQL` to enable use by other packages.

2014-10-13: 
  Simplified some namespace dependencies. Eliminated useless pseudo-R-squared statistics 
  from getSummary.mclogit

2014-08-23:
  Added 'anova' methods

2014-03-10:
  Refactored code -- algorithms should be more transparent and robust now (hopefully!).
  mclogit without and with random effects can handle missing values now.
  Fixed predict method -- use of napredict; handles single indep-variable situation now.
  Fixed embarassing typo -- prior weights do work now (again?). 
  Included AIC and BIC methods contributed by Nic Elliot <nic_elliot@yahoo.co.uk>
