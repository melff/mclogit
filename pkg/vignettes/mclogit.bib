  abstract = {The technique of iterative weighted linear regression can be used
                  to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters with
                  observations distributed according to some exponential family
                  and systematic effects that can be made linear by a suitable
                  transformation. A generalization of the analysis of variance
                  is given for these models using log-likelihoods. These
                  generalized linear models are illustrated by examples relating
                  to four distributions; the Normal, Binomial (probit analysis,
                  etc.), Poisson (contingency tables) and gamma (variance
                  components). The implications of the approach in designing
                  statistics courses are discussed.},
